# | Families are a collection of servers. To register      #
# | new servers into a family, you need to configure       #
# | your sub-servers appropriately.                        #
#                                                          #
# | If your sub-servers use family names that don't match  #
# | what you define in your  proxy, they will not          #
# | be registered.                                         #

#########################
#     Load Balancing    #
#########################
#
# If the family that this server is associated with has load balancing which involves "weight" you can set this server's weight level here.
# When servers are added to a weighted family. The family will first add players to the servers with the highest weight.
#
    weight: 0

#########################
#      Player Caps      #
#########################
    player-cap:
#
# The soft player cap will define, at what point, this server should stop accepting regular players.
# This allows you to mark the server as "full" while still allowing extra space for VIP and staff.
#
# To allow players to join past this point, you can give them one of two permissions:
# rustyconnector.softCapBypass - Bypass the soft cap of any server on this network
# rustyconnector.<family name>.softCapBypass - Bypass the soft cap of any server inside of this family
#
        soft: 20

#
# The hard player cap is the point at which no more players are allowed to join the server.
# if you wish to still allow high-level staff to access a server at hard player cap. You can grant them the permission:
# rustyconnector.hardCapBypass - Bypass the hard cap of any server on this network
# rustyconnector.<family name>.hardCapBypass - Bypass the hard cap of any server inside of this family. This also bypasses the soft cap too.
#
        hard: 30

#
# NOTE: If you set soft-player-cap to be the same number as hard-player-cap.
#       This server will run in player-limit mode. In which case, once player count
#       reaches the defined value, no more players will be allowed to enter.
#
# rustyconnector.<family name>.* - Bypass the hard and soft cap of the family.
