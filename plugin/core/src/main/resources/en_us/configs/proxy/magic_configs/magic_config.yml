    # At what point, should this server stop accepting regular players.
    # This allows you to mark the server as "full" while still allowing extra space for VIP and staff.
    #
    # To allow players to join past this point, you can give them one of two permissions:
    # rustyconnector.softCapBypass - Bypass the soft cap of any server on this network
    # rustyconnector.<family name>.softCapBypass - Bypass the soft cap of any server inside of this family
    #
    soft: 20

    #
    # At what point, should this server stop accepting soft-cap bypassing players.
    # if you wish to still allow high-level staff to access a server at hard player cap. You can grant them the permission:
    # rustyconnector.hardCapBypass - Bypass the hard cap of any server on this network
    # rustyconnector.<family name>.hardCapBypass - Bypass the hard cap of any server inside of this family. This also bypasses the soft cap too.
