# | Families are a collection of servers. To register      #
# | new servers into a family, you need to configure       #
# | your sub-servers appropriately.                        #
#                                                          #
# | If your sub-servers use family names that don't match  #
# | what you define here, they will not be registered.     #
#                                                          #

# | Ranked families implement matchmaking algorithms.      #
# | When a player attempts to connect to a ranked family   #
# | they will remain in their current family until         #
# | matchmaking is finished and a game can be started      #
# | the player is then connected to the family.            #

# | be locked and new sessions won't be able to join       #

# WARNING:                                                 #
#   Ranked families are disrespectful of player parties    #
#   if a party attempts to connect to a ranked family      #
#   they will be blocked and forced to separate before     #
#   they can join. Full party support will most likely     #
#   come in a future update.                               #
