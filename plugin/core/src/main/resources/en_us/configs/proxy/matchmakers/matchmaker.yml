# | Matchmakers are used by Ranked Families to handle      #
# | player ranking.                                        #
#                                                          #
# | When players connect to a ranked family, the           #
# | matchmaker will connect them to a game with other      #
# | players of the same rank, allowing for better          #
# | playing experiences.                                   #
