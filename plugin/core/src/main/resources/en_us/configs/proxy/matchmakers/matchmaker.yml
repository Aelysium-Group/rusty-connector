# | When players connect to a ranked family, the           #
# | matchmaker will connect them to a game with other      #
# | players of the same rank, allowing for better          #

    algorithm: RANDOMIZED

    # A numeric value representing how far apart players in a session are allowed to be in rank.
    # This value is ignored for the RANDOMIZED algorithm.
    # For example if you use WIN_LOSS and a player joins with a rank of 0.6 and variance is 0.1,
    # Players with ranks of 0.5 and 0.7 will be able to also join this player's session.

    #
    # Sometimes players will be too far apart in rank for the matchmaker to make a session.
    # Anytime there are enough players to be able to make a session
    # but no session is able to be made (because the variance range isn't large enough),
    # variance will be increased by this value until another session can be made.
    #
    # Once a session can be made, variance will reset to the default value.

    # If there are not enough players to even make a single session,
    # variance will stay at the base value.
