# | Matchmakers are used by Ranked Families to handle      #
# | player ranking.                                        #
#                                                          #
# | When players connect to a ranked family, the           #
# | matchmaker will connect them to a game with other      #
# | players of the same rank, allowing for better          #
# | playing experiences.                                   #

# | If you change algorithms, player skills, will reset.   #
# | If you switch from WIN_LOSS to RANDOM, the player      #
# | skills will reset, however if you switch back to       #
# | WIN_LOSS, the player's ranks will reload to what they  #
# | were before you switched away from WIN_LOSS.           #

#  ⚫ RANDOMIZED -                                         #
#           Randomly select players for a game.            #
#            Player skill levels are totally ignored.      #
#  ⚫ WIN_LOSS -                                           #
#           Ranks player based on their win/loss ratio.    #
#  ⚫ WIN_RATE -                                           #
#           Ranks players based on the percentage of how   #
#           many games they've won versus lost.            #
#           Win-rate ranking ignores the number of games   #
#           ranked players have played.                    #

# The teams to use for this gamemode.
# If you want the matchmaker to load exactly n number of players into a team,
# set `min-players` and `max-player` to the same number.
#
# Teams are not allowed to have the same name.
#
teams:
    - name: "red_team"
      min-players: 9

# A decimal representing the percentage that player's ranks are allowed to deviate from one-another.
#
# Cannot be set to 0.
#
# If algorithm is set to `RANDOM` this will be ignored.
#
# 0.1 means that other players in the round must have a rank within 10% of each-other.
# If set to 1.0, any players are allowed to be in a match together; regardless of rank.
# Setting to 1.0 is effectively the same as setting `algorithm` to RANDOM.
#
# For ranking systems with an infinitely high top-rank, variance will be calculated based on the highest ranking
# player in the matchmaking queue representing 100%.
#
variance: 0.2



#
# A LiquidTimestamp representing how often the matchmaker should review its waiting players and attempt to build a match.
# This should be set relatively low depending on what you expect player influxes to be.
# Can't be set lower than `3 SECONDS`.
#
# Keep in mind that this setting doesn't necessarily mean that new matches will be made every interval.
# Matches will only be made if there is a satisfactory number of players with the proper ranks.
