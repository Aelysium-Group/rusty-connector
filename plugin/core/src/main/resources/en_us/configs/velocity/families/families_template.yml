# | Families are a collection of servers. To register      #
# | new servers into a family, you need to configure       #
# | your sub-servers appropriately.                        #
#                                                          #
# | If your sub-servers use family names that don't match  #
# | what you define here, they will not be registered.     #
#                                                          #

# | be locked and new sessions won't be able to join       #
