# | Autoscalers hook directly into your Kubernetes instance #
# | to allow your families to dynamically resize the number #
# | of servers they use to handle different                 #
# | influxes of players.                                    #
#                                                           #
# | If you assign the same autoscaler to multiple families  #
# | They will all follow the rules of that one autoscaler.  #
#                                                           #
# | An elastic autoscaler will dynamically adjust server    #
# | volumes based on player influxes.                       #

# Traffic compensation will cause the autoscaler to raise it's `minimum capacity` during
