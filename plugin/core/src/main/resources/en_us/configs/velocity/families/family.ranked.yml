# | When a player attempts to connect to a ranked family   #
# | they will remain in their current family until         #
# | matchmaking is finished and the entire player team     #
# | is then connected to a server in the family.           #
#                                                          #
# | Once a server is in-session it will automatically      #
# | be locked and new sessions won't be able to join       #
