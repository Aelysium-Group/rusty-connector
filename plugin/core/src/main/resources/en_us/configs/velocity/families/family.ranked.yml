# | Ranked families implement matchmaking algorithms to    #
# | pair players together into "teams" which then          #
# | load into a specific server.                           #
# | When a player attempts to connect to a ranked family   #
# | they will remain in their current family until         #
# | matchmaking is finished and the entire player team     #
# | is then connected to a server in the family.           #
#                                                          #
# | Once a server is in-session it will automatically      #
# | be locked and new sessions won't be able to join       #
# | until the server is unlocked.                          #
