# The address used to connect to this server.
# This address should match what a player would enter if they were trying to connect directly to this server.
# Make sure you also include the port number!
#
# If you leave this empty, RustyConnector will grab this server's port number and attempt to resolve your server's address from that.
#
# If you're running a Kubernetes network and this server is a Pod within your cluster.
# This input will be ignored. Instead, RC will resolve the CoreDNS Hostname of this Pod and use that instead.

# Example: 127.0.0.1:25565
