# RustyConnector
Meet Rusty Connector! The premier Velocity player and server manager!
RustyConnector operates via Redis messaging to communicate with sub-servers. Once you've configured your server groups, called *families*, all you have to do is setup your sub-servers and they'll auto-register to your proxy whenever they're ready! You'll never have to touch your `velocity.toml` again when adding new servers to your network!

> Collect servers together into server families with built-in load balancing!
> 
> Create network-wide, family-wide, and individual server whitelists!
> 
> Support for multiple whitelist configurations!
> 
> Never again will you have to manually configure servers into your Velocity proxy with *server auto-registration*!
> 
> Ultra fast data-transmission with Redis integration!
