#               ---------------------------                #
# | Families are a collection of servers. To register      #
# | new servers into a family, you need to configure       #
# | your sub-servers appropriately.                        #
#                                                          #
# | If your sub-servers use family names that don't match  #
# | what you define in config.yml, they will               #
# | not be registered.                                     #
#                                                          #
# | In this config you can manage this family's            #
# | load-balancing, whitelist, and more!                   #

load-balancing:

#
# If set to `true`. the load balancer will attempt to put players into the servers with the highest `weight`
# `weight` is defined in the individual server configs on RustyConnector-paper.
#
# If multiple server are set to be the same weight level, the load balancer will use `algorithm` on those servers
# until they have been filled. It will then step to the next, lower, weight level and continue.

# | Depending on your needs, you might want to balance     #

#  ⚫ LEAST_CONNECTION -                                   #
#             Connects players to the server with the      #
#             the fewest players currently connected.      #
#             This mode is best if you want evenly         #
#             distributed players across all servers.      #
#  ⚫ MOST_CONNECTION -                                     #
#             Connects players to the server with the      #
#             the most players currently connected.        #
#             This mode is best if you want to fill        #
#             servers up as quickly as possible. An        #
#             example would be a minigame server.          #
#  ⚫ ROUND_ROBIN -                                        #
#             Every time a connection occurs, the next     #
#             server in the load balancer will be queued   #
#             for the next connection.                     #
#             Once the load balancer reaches the end of    #
#             the server queue, the load balancer will     #
#             loop back to the beginning and start again.  #
