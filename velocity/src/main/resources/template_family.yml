# | Families are a collection of servers. To register      #
# | new servers into a family, you need to configure       #
# | your sub-servers appropriately.                        #
#                                                          #
# | If your sub-servers use family names that don't match  #
# | what you define in config_template.yml, they will not be        #
# | registered.                                            #
#                                                          #
# | In this config you can manage this family's            #
# | load-balancing, whitelist, and more!                   #

# | Load balancing is the system through which networks    #

#               ---------------------------                #
# | Depending on your needs, you might want to balance     #
# | player influxes in various ways.                       #
# | RustyConnector currently supports the following.       #
# | balancing algorithms if there are other algorithms     #
# | you'd like to see in the future, let us know!          #
#                                                          #
#  ⚫ TROUGH - A "Least Connection" based algorithm.        #
#             Connects players to the server with the      #
#             fewest players currently connected.          #
#  ⚫ CASCADE - A "Fixed Weighting" based algorithm.        #
#             servers that are assigned a higher "level"   #
#             will get filled up first, before the         #
#             algorithm starts filling up lower level      #
#             servers.                                     #
#       NOTE: For it to work properly, the Cascade         #
#             algorithm will require additional            #
#             configuration on the servers in this         #
#             family.                                      #

# Make sure you define proper "priority-index" inside the configs of your sub-servers of this family!
# Otherwise, this algorithm will just work like a "Round Robin" and dump players into
# the servers as it sees fit.

# | RustyConnector attempts to be as flexible as possible  #
# | when configuring whitelists!                           #
# | To setup a whitelist, you'll need to navigate to the   #
# | "whitelists" folder and follow the directions in the   #
# | provided whitelist-template.                           #
#                                                          #
# | More often than not, you will have multiple whitelist  #
# | configurations that you may want to switch between     #
# | during various points in your network's lifetime.      #
# | This system allows you to setup as many pre-defined    #
# | whitelists as you'd like, and enable or switch between #
# | then whenever you want!                                #
