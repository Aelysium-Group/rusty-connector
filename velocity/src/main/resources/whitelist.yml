# | You are free to use all three or only one of these     #
# | criteria to check if someone is whitelisted!           #
# | As a bear minimum, you MUST at least include username  #
#                                                          #
# NOTE: It's not hard for any good hacker to spoof an      #
#       IP Address. As such, make sure you are properly    #
#       validating your connections and not using only IP  #
#       Addresses as a whitelist criteria!                 #
# NOTE: Make sure that if you are working with player      #
#       IP Addresses that you properly inform your members #
#       and that you never leak that information!          #
