# | Families are a collection of servers. To register      #
# | new servers into a family, you need to configure       #
# | your sub-servers appropriately.                        #
#                                                          #
# | If your sub-servers use family names that don't match  #
# | what you define in config.yml, they will               #
# | not be registered.                                     #
#                                                          #
# | In this config you can manage this family's            #
# | load-balancing, whitelist, and more!                   #

# | When players first connect to a static family, they    #

# | that server will be linked to that player and anytime  #

#               ---------------------------                #
# | Load balancing is the system through which networks    #
# | manage player influxes by spreading out players        #
# | across various server nodes.                           #
#                                                          #
# | In static families, load balancing only effects the    #
# | first time a player connects to the family.            #
# | Once the player connects for the first time, the       #
# | server they connected to will be remembered and        #
# | they'll be joined to that server on                    #
# | consecutive connections in the future too.             #
#                                                          #
# | The server that get's linked to a player is called     #
# | that player's "Home Server".                           #

# until they have been filled. It will then step to the next, lower, weight level and continue.
