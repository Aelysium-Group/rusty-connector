# | In order to operate, RustyConnector passes lots of     #
# | data around. In this file, you can control what does   #
# | and does not appear in your console when               #
# | something happens!                                     #

# | One of our biggest pet peeves is plugins that default  #
# | with everything turned on, and then you have to spend  #
# | hours to turn it all off. Because of this, everything  #
# | in this config is off by default except for            #
# | certain important messages,                            #
