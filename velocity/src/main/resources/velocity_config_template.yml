families:

#
# The root family. Once a player connects and is validated.
# This is the family that they will automatically be routed to.
#
# The root family will ALWAYS be defined as a `scalar` family.
# Having a root family defined as `static` is not currently possible
#
    root-family:
        name: "lobby"

#
# If a player is kicked or disconnected from a family in this proxy.
# Should the root family catch them? If not, they will disconnect from the whole network.
# This setting is great if you want a player to join back into the lobby if they get kicked from
# a gamemode or sub-family.
#
# Currently, this method will only work for certain if all servers in the root-family are guaranteed to
# allow players to join. (i.e. they can't have a whitelist set).
# If some servers in your root family have whitelists set, a player may not be able to connect to the family!

# Families defined here are optimized for stateful minecraft gamemodes.

# | To setup a whitelist, you'll need to navigate to the   #
