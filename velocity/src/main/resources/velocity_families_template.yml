# | Families are a collection of servers. To register      #
# | new servers into a family, you need to configure       #
# | your sub-servers appropriately.                        #
#                                                          #
# | If your sub-servers use family names that don't match  #
# | what you define here, they will not be registered.     #

    # a gamemode or sub-family.

# Families defined here are optimized for stateless minecraft gamemodes.
# They support various load balancing algorithms and auto-scaling.

#    Static Families    #
#########################
#
# Families defined here are optimized for stateful minecraft gamemodes.
# When players join a static family, their initial server will be memorized, and they'll be connected
# back into that server on future family connections as well.
#
# To define a new static family change static from `static: []` to:
#
# static:
#       - "family name"
#       - "family name"
#
# Static families require that MySQL is set up.

#   Rounded Families    #
#########################
#
# Families defined here are optimized for round/session based minecraft gamemodes.
# Players can get registered into a "Round" and then once a threshold is reached, the round will start
# and all the player's registered to the round, will be connected to the family.
#
# This family will keep track of any active sessions already running. If all servers
# have active sessions, this family will wait until a session is finished before connecting the next round
# and starting another session.
