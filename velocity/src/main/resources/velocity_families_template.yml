# | new servers into a family, you need to configure       #
# | your sub-servers appropriately.                        #
#                                                          #
# | If your sub-servers use family names that don't match  #
# | what you define here, they will not be registered.     #

#    Static Families    #
#########################
#
# Families defined here are optimized for stateful minecraft gamemodes.
# When players join a static family, their initial server will be memorized, and they'll be connected
# back into that server on future family connections as well.
#
# To define a new static family change static from `static: []` to:
#
# static:
#       - "family name"
#       - "family name"
#
# Static families require that MySQL is set up.
#
static: []

#
# MySQL is required in order for static families to operate.
